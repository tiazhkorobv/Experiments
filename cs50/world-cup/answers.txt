Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With 100 simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations.
