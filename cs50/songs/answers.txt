If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
   To calculate audio aura is possible by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of that 100 songs.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
   It is could be better to use machine learning algorithms to analyze the emotional and psychological effects of different types of music for each user and personalize his(her) audio aura accordingly.
